# Hospital Wait Time Reduction Knowledge Base
# Using Six Sigma DMAIC Methodology

## Registration Bottleneck
Problem:
Registration delays occur due to manual paperwork, insufficient counters, or peak-hour surges.

DMAIC Steps:
- Define: State the problem clearly, e.g., “Average registration time is 20 minutes.”
- Measure: Collect data on arrival times, check-in duration, and staff availability.
- Analyze: Identify peak hours, bottleneck counters, and repeated manual tasks.
- Improve:
  1. Introduce online pre-registration portals where patients fill forms before arrival.
  2. Install self-service kiosks with QR/barcode scanning.
  3. Use electronic health records (EHR) to auto-fetch patient history.
  4. Cross-train staff to handle multiple tasks.
- Control: Set service level targets (e.g., <5 minutes per patient). Audit performance weekly.

Sustain:
- Monitor registration dashboards daily.
- Adjust staffing schedules to match peak demand.
- Collect patient feedback on registration ease.

## Triage Bottleneck
Problem:
Triage delays occur when patient assessment is slow, documentation is manual, or staff are overburdened.

DMAIC Steps:
- Define: Specify problem, e.g., “Patients wait 15 minutes before triage nurse assessment.”
- Measure: Track time between patient arrival and triage completion.
- Analyze: Identify delays caused by documentation, limited staff, or mis-prioritization.
- Improve:
  1. Introduce digital triage forms with dropdowns/checklists.
  2. Implement quick-assessment tools (e.g., ESI scales).
  3. Allocate extra triage staff during peak hours.
  4. Train nurses on rapid assessment techniques.
- Control: Monitor triage times with a real-time dashboard.

Sustain:
- Periodically retrain staff.
- Update triage protocols to reflect latest evidence-based guidelines.

## Lab Delays
Problem:
Lab result delays affect diagnosis, treatment initiation, and patient flow.

DMAIC Steps:
- Define: Example: “Lab reports are delayed by an average of 1 hour.”
- Measure: Track sample collection-to-report turnaround time.
- Analyze: Identify steps causing delay—sample transport, testing, or reporting.
- Improve:
  1. Use pneumatic tube systems or dedicated staff for fast sample transport.
  2. Automate lab analyzers for common tests.
  3. Enable electronic result delivery to doctors’ dashboards.
  4. Separate STAT (urgent) samples from routine tests.
- Control: Track daily average TAT (turnaround time) and set SLA targets.

Sustain:
- Periodic maintenance of lab machines.
- Review workload distribution among technicians.

## Consultation Delays
Problem:
Consultation delays occur due to overbooked schedules, uneven doctor allocation, or lengthy consultations.

DMAIC Steps:
- Define: State issue, e.g., “Patients wait 40 minutes to see a doctor after triage.”
- Measure: Record time between triage completion and doctor consultation.
- Analyze: Check if delays are due to uneven doctor distribution, lengthy consultations, or poor scheduling.
- Improve:
  1. Implement appointment scheduling systems with time slots.
  2. Introduce teleconsultation for follow-ups.
  3. Allocate doctors based on patient load and specialty demand.
  4. Use scribes or assistants to handle documentation so doctors focus on patients.
- Control: Track consultation times and reschedule based on trends.

Sustain:
- Regularly balance OPD schedules.
- Collect patient satisfaction feedback.

## Discharge Delays
Problem:
Discharge delays occur due to pending clearances, late paperwork, or pharmacy bottlenecks.

DMAIC Steps:
- Define: Example: “Average discharge time is 3 hours after decision.”
- Measure: Capture time from discharge decision to patient exit.
- Analyze: Identify causes (billing, pharmacy delays, paperwork).
- Improve:
  1. Start discharge planning at admission (preparing documents early).
  2. Use discharge checklists for doctors, nurses, and billing staff.
  3. Introduce electronic billing and prescription forwarding to pharmacy.
  4. Create a discharge lounge where patients wait comfortably after clearance.
- Control: Track discharge TAT and aim for <1 hour.

Sustain:
- Regular audits of discharge records.
- Continuous staff training on discharge workflow.

## Overall Wait Time Reduction
Problem:
Long wait times across multiple departments reduce patient satisfaction and increase hospital crowding.

DMAIC Steps:
- Define: Clearly state issue, e.g., “Average total OPD journey takes 2 hours.”
- Measure: Map patient journey—arrival to exit—recording times at each step.
- Analyze: Use Value Stream Mapping (VSM) or Pareto charts to identify major bottlenecks.
- Improve:
  1. Streamline workflows across departments.
  2. Introduce digital queue management with real-time wait time display.
  3. Use predictive analytics to forecast patient load and adjust staffing.
  4. Apply Lean tools (5S, Kaizen) to remove wasteful steps.
- Control: Create a hospital performance dashboard tracking wait times.

Sustain:
- Periodic Kaizen events for continuous improvement.
- Patient feedback surveys to measure satisfaction trends.
